When deleting files, they are not always entirely removed from storage. **Secure deletion** and **full-disk encryption** help mitigate this risk.
### Secure deletion
Secure deletion tools overwrite deleted files with random data, making recovery difficult. Without this, deleted files may leave remnants on the hard drive that can be recovered by forensic tools.

### Full-Disk Encryption
Full-disk encryption secures all data on a device, including deleted files, by encrypting the entire storage drive. Even if someone gains access to the device, they cannot read its contents without the decryption key. 

Encryption also helps prevent data exposure from **ransomware**, a type of malware that encrypts user files and demands payment for their release. Having a backup and using encrypted storage adds an extra layer of protection.

In conclusion, remember these following to secure yourself from the Internet
- Use a password manager.
- Use two-factor authentication.
- Use (end-to-end) encryption.

That's the end of the course. ^^
