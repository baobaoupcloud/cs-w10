### Two-factor authentication (2FA)
Two-factor authentication adds an extra layer of security beyond a password. It combines something you know (your password) with something you have (a one-time code or physical device). These are implemented as one-time passwords of sorts that are sent to an email, device, or phone number.

### Types of 2FA
- **SMS or Email Codes**: A one-time code sent to your phone or email. While convenient, it is less secure if SMS or email access is compromised.
- **Authentication Apps**: Apps like Google Authenticator generate time-based codes that are more secure than SMS.
- **Physical Security Keys**: Devices like YubiKey require a physical key to access an account, providing the highest security.

2FA significantly strengthens account security but can add inconvenience if you lose access to the second factor. It is, however, one of the most effective defenses against unauthorized access.
