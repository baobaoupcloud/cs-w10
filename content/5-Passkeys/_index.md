Passkeys are a new, more secure alternative to passwords. They use cryptographic keys instead of traditional passwords for authentication.

A passkey system relies on a **private key** stored on your device and a **challenge** from the server. The private key creates a digital signature in response to the challenge, verifying your identity without needing a password.

Passkeys eliminate risks of password reuse, weak passwords, and many traditional password-based attacks.
There's no need to remember complex passwords, and phishing attacks are less likely to succeed.

Hence, passwords and usernames may soon become obsolete.
